\title{Visualise a data.frame like vis_dat, but takes a guess at to telling you what it contains.}
\usage{
vis_guess(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame object}
}
\description{
\code{vis_guess} just like vis_dat, vis_guess gives you an at-a-glance ggplot object of what is inside a dataframe. Except this time, vis_guess uses `readr` to help it guess what the individual cells are. These cells are coloured according to what class they are and whether the values are missing. As \code{vis_guess} returns a ggplot object, it is very easy to customize. Currently very slow.
