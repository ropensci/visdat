# How to install

visdat is available on CRAN

```{r install-cran, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("visdat")

```

If you would like to use the development version, install from github with:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/visdat")
```

# What does visdat do?

Initially inspired by [`csv-fingerprint`](https://github.com/setosa/csv-fingerprint), `vis_dat` helps you visualise a dataframe and "get a look at the data" by displaying the variable classes in a dataframe as a plot with `vis_dat`, and getting a brief look into missing data patterns using `vis_miss`.

The name `visdat` was chosen as I think in the future it could be integrated with [`testdat`](https://github.com/ropensci/testdat). The idea being that first you visualise your data (`visdat`), then you run tests from `testdat` to fix them.

There are two main commands in the `visdat` package: 

- `vis_dat()` visualises a dataframe showing you what the classes of the columns are, and also displaying the missing data.

- `vis_miss()` visualises just the missing data, and allows for missingness to be clustered and columns rearranged. `vis_miss()` is similar to `missing.pattern.plot` from the [`mi`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mi/index.html) package. Unfortunately `missing.pattern.plot` is no longer in the `mi` package (as of 14/02/2016).

You can read more about visdat in the vignette, ["using visdat"](http://visdat.njtierney.com/articles/using_visdat.html).

There are also experimental functions, which include guessing values,  comparing two dataframes, and adding interactivity. These are described in detail in the vignette ["Experimental Features of visdat"](http://visdat.njtierney.com/articles/experimental_features.html).

# Examples

## Using `vis_dat()`

Let's see what's inside the `airquality` dataset from base R, which contains information about daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. More information about the dataset can be found with `?airquality`.


```{r vis-dat-aq}

library(visdat)

vis_dat(airquality)

```

The plot above tells us that R reads this dataset as having numeric and integer values, with some missing data in `Ozone` and `Solar.R`. The classes are represented on the legend, and missing data represented by grey. The column/variable names are listed on the x axis. 

By default, `vis_dat` sorts the columns according to the type of the data in the vectors. You can turn this off by setting `sort_type = FALSE`. 

```{r vis-dat-aq-sort-type}

vis_dat(airquality, 
        sort_type = FALSE)

```

### With many kinds of data

To demonstrate what visdat looks like when you have different kinds of data, we can look at the dataset `typical_data`, provided within `visdat`, and created with the excellent [`wakefield` package](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield).

```{r vis-dat-typical-data}

vis_dat(typical_data)

```

We can also look into using even wider data, looking at `typical_larger_data`

```{r vis-dat-typical-larger-data}

vis_dat(typical_data_large)

```


## Using `vis_miss()`

We can explore the missing data further using `vis_miss()`.

```{r vis-miss-aq}

vis_miss(airquality)

```

The percentages of missing/complete in `vis_miss` are accurate to 1 decimal place.

You can cluster the missingness by setting `cluster = TRUE`.

```{r vis-miss-aq-cluster}

vis_miss(airquality, 
         cluster = TRUE)

```

The columns can also just be arranged by columns with most missingness, by setting `sort_miss = TRUE`.

```{r vis-miss-aq-sort-miss}

vis_miss(airquality,
         sort_miss = TRUE)

```

`vis_miss` indicates when there is a very small amount of missing data at <0.1% missingness.

```{r vis-miss-test}

test_miss_df <- data.frame(x1 = 1:10000,
                           x2 = rep("A", 10000),
                           x3 = c(rep(1L, 9999), NA))

vis_miss(test_miss_df)

```

`vis_miss` will also indicate when there is no missing data at all.

```{r vis-miss-mtcars}

vis_miss(mtcars)

```


# Thank yous

Thank you to Ivan Hanigan who [first commented](http://www.njtierney.com/r/missing%20data/rbloggers/2015/12/01/ggplot-missing-data/#comment-2388263747) this suggestion after I made a blog post about an initial prototype `ggplot_missing`, and Jenny Bryan, whose [tweet](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/679011378414268416) got me thinking about `vis_dat`, and for her code contributions that removed a lot of errors.

Thank you to Hadley Wickham for suggesting the use of the internals of `readr` to make `vis_guess` work.

Thank you to Miles McBain for his suggestions on how to improve `vis_guess`. This resulted in making it at least 2-3 times faster.

Thanks to Carson Sievert for writing the code that combined `plotly` with `visdat`, and for Noam Ross for suggesting this in the first place.

Finally thank you to [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci) and it's amazing [onboarding process](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding), this process has made visdat a much better package, thanks to the editor Noam Ross (@noamross), and the reviewers Sean Hughes (@seaaan) and Mara Averick (@batpigandme).
